# RTXStableDiffusionXL
In repository we use the Hugging Face Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model to create images from text prompts, based on a Jupiter Notebook installed using Nvidia's AI Workbench. We are also going to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion XL model based on our own images, using DreamBooth.
